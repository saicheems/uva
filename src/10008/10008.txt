What's cryptanalysis?

Process
I solved this problem by using an array of pairs. I initialized each pair to
have the character values between 0 and 255 to represent the entire character
set. The second value in each pair begins at 0. For each character in each
line, I checked to see that it was in the alphabet, and if so the integer in
the corresponding capital letter pair would be incremented. After all the lines
are read, I sort using a custom compare function and print the results of all
characters where with at least one occurrence.
