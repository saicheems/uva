Process
Solving this problem is a matter of keeping track of days, the day of the week,
and each party's hartal index. Iterate through the days and add to the hartal
count when at least one party has a hartal on a given index. Do not operate on
days Friday and Saturday (when days % 7 != 0 && days % 7 != 6).
