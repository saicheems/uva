Process
This problem was relatively straightforward due to the constraints. The issues I
had were mostly with getting the problem to run within the time limit. My
approach was to use the lower_bound function to find the first value on each
line >= L. From there I checked each increasing diagonal index with value > U
and incremented the cur_max counter. At this point I had a pretty good process
but was still getting TLE. The fix was to start the loop going through the
diagonal values at the cur_max. Obviously it makes no sense to check smaller
boxes after a bigger box has already been found.
