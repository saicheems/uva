Jugs

Process
I solved this problem using bfs. I kept track of the number of gallons in jugs
a and b and a vector of moves. I had difficulty getting the problem to run
within the time limit. The solution was to prune by keeping track of visited
states. I marked each combination of volumes as visited after adding them to
the queue. If we do not explore states that have been visited, the code runs
well within the time limit.
