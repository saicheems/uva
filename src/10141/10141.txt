Request for proposal

Process
Solve this one by following the directions. Keep running bests of compliance
and cost. If a higher compliance is found, or an equal compliance with lower
cost, store that proposal. I chose to use cin for simplicity, so if you go the
same route make sure you use getline to read in the requirements and the name
of the proposal as well, as they can be multiple words. Note that the
requirements need not be stored. All you need to know is the number of
requirements and the number of met requirements for each proposal. The actual
strings listed are fluff and should be read and ignored, since we are given
that all met requirements are in the requirement list and none are duplicated.
