Pizza cutting

Process
To solve this one, you need to find a relationship between the number of cuts
you're making and the number of slices made as a result.
Cuts	Slices	Relationship
0	1	1
1	2	1 + 1
2	4	2 + 2
3	7	4 + 3
4	11	7 + 4
5	16	11 + 5
As you can observe, the recurrence relation is a = n + (n - 1) where a is 1
when n = 0. A recursive implementation can be written that will run in time.
Alternatively, there is an O(1) solution. The function (n * (n + 1)) / 2 + 1 is
the solved recurrence relation and will return the correct number of slices.
