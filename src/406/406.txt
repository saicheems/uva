Process
First use the sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes under 1000. Use
binary search to find the first prime greater than or equal to N, and decrement
the index until the prime is less than or equal to N. From here, we look at the
size of the prime list to determine the number of elements we should print out.
After calculating these, calculate the start and end indices. If the size of
the center list is equal to or exceeds the size of the total list, print all
primes from 1 to N.
