Containers

Process
This problem can be solved through the use of a vector of stacks. The premise
is that a stack of containers must be separated into S stacks such that the top
crate on at least one of the stacks can be loaded on the current ship. The
ships load in alphabetical order, so we can stack with respect to the alphabet.
Start with one stack and add the first letter. From then on, check each stack
to see if the current letter can be added. If the current letter is less than
or equal to the one on top of a stack, add it to that stack. Otherwise, check
the next one. If none of the letters on top of any stacks can support the
current container, add a new stack to the vector and increment your count. This
greedy solution will be accepted.  Note that you should be reading the
containers in from left to right. For the sample ACMICPC, the stacks produced
are A; CCC; IM; P.
