Primary arithmetic

Process
This problem was a PAIN to get AC. The premise is to count the number of carry
operations done when using the grade school addition algorithm. I chose to turn
each number into a c string. Trick #1: The input can be up to 9 digits, use a
long long to be sure you can handle the max value. Trick #2: You'll have to
read the strings from right to left to conduct the addition properly - so you
may have to keep track of indices on the two numbers separately for
convenience. Trick #3: When only 1 carry operation is used, you must print "1
carry operation.", instead of "1 carry operationS."
