Process
This problem is another example of a case where an ambiguous problem statement
makes things difficult. The premise is to determine whether or not the absolute
differences between the values of the array contain the values 1 through n - 1.
The bit that is unclear in the problem description is that the differences need
not be sorted. In the example array, 1 4 2 3, the differences are 3, 2, 1. The
array 1 4 3 1 with differences 3 1 2 would also be valid despite the fact that
the sequence is not ordered - it is only important that values 1 to n - 1 are
present. Note that the sequence must start from 1, meaning that differences 3 2
1 will be valid, while 4 3 2 will not.
