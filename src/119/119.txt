Process
This problem is both simple and tricky. For each person, we are calculating NET
gain - it's important to remember that. First, for each person, if they are
giving money to one or more people, we decrement their net gain by the amount
they're giving away. Then, we add back the amount they don't give away (use mod
division). For each person we're giving money to, increment their net worth by
(gift amount / number of giftees). If a person is giving no money to anyone
(the trick case), they have NO NET GAIN, so we do not increment or decrement
their worth for that iteration.
For example, for input:
3
dave laura owen
dave 200 0
laura 100 0
owen 100 0

Output is:
dave 0
laura 0
owen 0
