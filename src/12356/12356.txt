Process
So the first time I solved this I used an O(N^2) (I think) solution, and got
TLE. On closer inspection I should've realized it considering the size of the
input (10^5). On the second run, I had something more clever thanks to the
conditions of the problem. Soldiers that already died are not included in the L
and R values, so we can maintain two arrays LS and RS that hold the index of
the next surviving soldier to the left of and right of index i respectively.
After each death listing, we update this indices.
