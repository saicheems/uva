Process
This one breaks down into a shortest paths problem. We're given an adjacency
matrix describing the communication costs between several connected processors.
Our goal is to find the maximum of the minimum amount of times required to send
a message between processor 1 and all other processors. Thus we can use floyd
warshall and output the maximum value in the first column of the weight matrix
as the answer.
