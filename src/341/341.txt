Non-stop travel

Process
This problem asks for the shortest path between two nodes. A minimal weight path
is guaranteed, so we can use standard bellman-ford to calculate the shortest
paths between the given source node and all other nodes. Just trace the path
back from the destination node and print the weight of the path to that node.
