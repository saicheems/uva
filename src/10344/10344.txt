23 out of 5

Process
This problem gave me some troubles, as I don't think the problem description is
very clear. Make sure you test all permutations of the 5-tuples. I used
next_permutation in conjunction with a recursive search to find whether an
arrangement that yielded 23 existed. Make sure you sort the tuple array before
running through the permutations - the values are not guaranteed to be
presented in lexicographical order.
