Box of bricks

Process
This problem can be solved easily by observing that the minimum number of
blocks you must move is the number of blocks higher than the final stack
height. Sum the total number of blocks and divide by the number of stacks to
get the final stack height. Then iterate through the stacks and add the blocks
above the final stack height.
