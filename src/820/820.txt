I solved this problem using a code snippet from "Competitive Programming 3." It
is a max flow problem and thus you should use the Edmonds Karp algorithm. I
don't understand it very well, so I'll be revisiting this one at some point -
the code is very dense and not immediately obvious. Note that for this problem
that when populating your residual matrix, edges go both ways in this graph,
and multiple edges from node a to node b can be given. In this case, sum the
weights to get a total weight in any direction.
