Process
We can solve this one with bfs. From the given start point, we search all
possible knight moves until we hit the correct tile. To get the length of the
path, we can store best lengths (because we are using a bfs) in a matrix and
update as we go. The length at the starting point should be 0, and the length
at each cell to be explored should be the length from the current cell + 1.
