Reverse and add

Process
Solving this problem is a matter of following the process outlined in the
problem. It's a bit of a pain to reverse and convert strings, but we can use
the C++ methods atol and sprintf to do what we need. I believe you'll need to
use longs in this problem, as the palindrome can be as large as 4,294,967,295.
