Trainsorting

Process
It takes some thinking to apply this problem to the longest increasing
subsequence problem. You can use the O(N^2) dynamic programming solution twice
to calculate the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing subsequences
starting from any integer. The longest train car sequence is equal to the
maximum of (La[i] + Lb[i] - 1), where La and Lb are the lengths of the longest
increasing and decreasing subsequenes starting from index i respectively. The
reason this works is that starting at an integer i, all integers in the longest
increasing subsequence above i can be added to the end of the train array. All
integers below, in the longest decreasing subsequence, can be added to the
beginning.
