Bicoloring

Process
This one's a simple traversal and coloring problem. Maintain a adjacency list
and add bidirectional edges. Also, keep a color vector with all nodes set to
initial color 0. Set the color of node 0 to 1 and begin traversing. If you can
travel to a node with color 1 or 2, and the current node has the same color,
then the graph is not bicolorable. If the node you are traveling to is not
colored, color it with the one opposite of the current node and traverse on it.
Note you only have to traverse from one node as the graph is strongly
connected.
