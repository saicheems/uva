Process
This problem is a matter of writing methods to determine whether the input is a
palindrome or a mirrored string or both. I used a map to hold the characters
and their mirrored mappings because I think it's the least space intensive
method. Note that for the mirrored string, you must compare each character with
it's complement on the other half of the string. You will also have to compare
the middle character (3rd character in a 5 letter string) against it's own
mapping to make sure it mirrors. The palindrome method is easier - compare the
left half of letters to the right half. The middle letter doesn't matter in
this case.
