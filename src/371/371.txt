Process
The basics of the problem require that you follow the directions. I made a
recursive function (non-recursive would be better though) that acts on the
rules. If you look at the sample patterns provided, there is a lot of
repetition in the sequence we calculate. As a result, the problem benefits from
memoization. Store the result of each call and return it in the future if we've
already computed it. Note also that the test input will give L and H backwards
as well. You need to swap these values if they come in the wrong order in your
program.
