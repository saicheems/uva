Minesweeper

Process
We're given a grid with the mines labeled with a '*' and all other spaces with
a '.' We want to output a grid with the non '*' spaces filled in with the
number of '*'s adjacent. I solved it by copying the grid, changing all '.' to
'0', looping through, and running my incr method when a '*' shows up. Then, I
increment the count on all cells adjacent to the '*'. Note that you shouldn't
print a newline after the last output.
