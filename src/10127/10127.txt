The immediately obvious solution to this problem is to try brute force.
Generate the sequences of ones and try modulus n until we get 0. Unfortunately,
we run into the limits of integers as the sequence becomes long. Instead, we
can apply a modulus trick. We can operate on the remainder of the operation (*
10 + 1) and continue until we end up with 0 mod. The following resource helped
me understand:
