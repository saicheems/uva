Process
This problem is a small variant on all pairs shortest paths. The premise is to
caluclate the shortest possible time between two points and then the shortest
distance. Therefore, we use floyd warshall to calculate the shortest time first.
To get the shorest path given shorest time, maintain distance in a separate cost
matrix and update it when two equivalent times are found and the distance weight
for those nodes is less than the current (time[i][j] == time[i][k] + time[k][j]
&& dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]). Also, you must account for multiple
roads between the same two places - store with priority the lowest time and
then lowest distance.
