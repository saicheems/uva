The O(N^2) approach to generating valid values for this problem will fail, so
we need a better alternative. We can do a bit of math to produce an equation
that will benefit our calculations:
The summation from 1 to N is equal to N * (N + 1) / 2 (you can look this up if
you do not believe me).
We are looking for a value C such that given
1 2 ... C ... N
the sums from 1 to C and C to N are equal.
We can define this mathematically as follows:
(C - 1) * C / 2 = N * (N + 1) / 2 - C * (C + 1) / 2
(C - 1) * C + C * (C + 1) = N * (N + 1)
C^2 - C + C^2 + C = N * (N + 1)
2 * C^2 = N * (N + 1)
C^2 = N * (N + 1) / 2

Thus, if there is an integer C such that the root of N * (N + 1) / 2 is an
integer, the values C and N are a valid pair that satisfy the conditions.
