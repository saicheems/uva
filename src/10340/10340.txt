Process
To solve this problem, you can use the same method you might use to find
whether or not a substring occurs within a string. Make a linear pass through
the characters of the second string and manage an index variable for the
substring (first string). For each character that matches, increment the index
variable. If all the characters in the substring are seen in the order they
appear, then output "Yes".
