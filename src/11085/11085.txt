Back to the 8-queens

Process
This problem can be solved with standard recursive backtracing. You just need
to move linearly from row 0 to row 7 and use recursive calls to return the
minimum number of changes needed to make a valid 8-queens board. While
recursing, if the current queen placement is valid (the one given in the
input), then don't add to the change count. You still need to check all other
possible placements for that row however as it's possible no valid arrangement
exists where that queen is in that position.

Input
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
6 4 1 3 1 4 4 1
6 4 7 1 8 2 5 3
1 7 2 6 3 5 8 4

Output
Case 1: 7
Case 2: 7
Case 3: 5
Case 4: 0
Case 5: 2
