Process
This problem took some time for me due to unclear instructions. I recommend
using getchar to read the input character by character for your logic. Skip
non-alphabetic characters and apply the rules for Pig-Latin. The trick here is
that words that are not followed by a non-alphabetic character do not have "ay"
appended to them.
For example, for the input:
hello
hello.
The output is:
ello
ellohay.
