Hanoi tower troubles again!

Process
I would categorize this problem as a simulation one. It can be solved easily by
writing a method that follows the rules and fills the tower. Basically, you go
in order through the balls starting at 1, 2, 3... and try to place them such
that the ball and the one under sum to a perfect square. If no rod has a ball
on the top such that this condition can be met, place the ball on an empty rod.
If no empty rods exist and no rod can fulfill the condition, the simulation is
over. It should be apparent then that the case mentioned in the problem (-1 if
infinite balls can be placed), is not possible and so you should not bother
figuring that out. Also you need only keep track of the last ball on the stack.
