This problem should be pretty simple to figure out. Essentially we want to count power of 2s until
we can't anymore. My solution was to bit shift the input left until I hit 0. It should be apparent
that this would work - you can verify with an example on paper that checking increasing powers of
two will yield the optimal number of copy-pastes.
