Grid successors

Process
I had some difficulty at first understanding what this problem was asking. It
wants you to apply a function f to a grid g which sets each cell equal to the
sum modulo 2 of the cells above, below, left and right to it. It's apparent
then that a cell can only take the value 1 or 0. We need to apply this function
recursively until a graph where all cells are '0' presents.
