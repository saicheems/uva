Process
This problem is essentially asking you whether or not the number of factors in
the input number is even. One way to go about it is to check all the values i
below n and flip a flag if n is divisible by i. This approach will TLE. The
correct approach to make the observation that numbers that are not perfect
squares have an even number of factors. Perfect squares have an odd number of
factors. For example, 4 has factors 1 2 and 4 (odd). 12 has factors 1 2 3 4 6
12 (even). Therefore if n is a perfect square, output "yes". Otherwise output
"no".
