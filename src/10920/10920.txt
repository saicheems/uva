Spiral tap

Process
So in my first go at this problem I tried to precompute the cartesian
coordinates of the maximum size of the grid. After realizing the number of
cells for the maximum size grid was 999999^2, I had to drop the approach. Just
based on the amount of input, it should be apparent that we want to figure out
some mathematical truth about the grid that will result in a O(1) solution.
Notice that the the top right corner of each layer in the spiral has a square
of an odd number (1, 3, 5, 7, ..., n). We can use this as a positioning element
to figure out what ring P is in. To find out what ring we're in, we take the
square root of P and calculate the next odd value above (if P is not already a
perfect square). From there, we can do some arithmetic based on what side (I
calculated this in the 'group' variable in my code) of the ring P is on. Also,
you'll want to use long longs as the values of input and output can get pretty
large.
