Process
This problem is essentially asking us to calculate n choose k (google binomial
coefficient). The formula is n!/(k!*(n-k)!). Our issue is that while the final
result is guaranteed to be within the bounds of an integer, the individual
factorials are not. So, we must cut out some multiplications. Immediately we
can remove a good amount of multiplications by observing that some terms on the
top and bottom will be eliminated due to the factorial. We can start
calculating the numerator from max(a - b, b) + 1 to a. To prevent us from going
over the int limit though, as we calculate the numerator we must divide by
terms in the denominator. In my solution I have an outer for loop calculating
the numerator and an inner for loop dividing by terms in the denominator while
possible.
