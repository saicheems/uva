I had more issues with this problem than I should have... mostly stemming from
a poor reading of the instructions. Note that the path can start and end in any
row - not just the first and last respectively. I used a recursive DP approach
with memoization. The relation is that the best cost path from one cell is the
value of the current cell + the minimum cost to all adjacent cells. Make sure
you update so you pull the lexicographically smallest path.
