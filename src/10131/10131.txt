Process
To solve this one, first observe that we can sort a single column (I chose to
sort the IQ values) and run the longest increasing subsequence algorithm on the
other.  You'll need to make a small modification to check for the case where
there are equivalent IQ values but differing weights (or vice versa). Note that
in the problem statement the inequalities are *strict*. Therefore within your
LIS algorithm, you need to check that the next weight in the sequence is
greater than the previous weight, and the next IQ is less than the previous
one.
