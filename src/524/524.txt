Prime ring problem

Process
This problem can be solved easily using recursive backtracing. Make a process
for checking whether a number is prime (I chose a less efficient method that
just checks all values under the square root to see if they divide evenly).
Have a recursive method that keeps track of the current digit, and check values
2 to n to see if you can place them in the array given that the previous number
and the new value sum to a prime number. You will need to keep track of the
digits you used as well as the array you're building. Finally, your base case
should check for your place in the array and whether the last value + 1 is
prime (wraparound).
