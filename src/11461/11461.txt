This problem can be solved with a simple search through an array of
preprocessed squares. First generate the squares <= 100000 and then use some
method to find the first index >= a and the first index > b. I used a basic
linear search because the input size was so small... but if you want to solve
it a bit faster you could write your own binary search method or use the
standard library binary search methods (lower_bound, upper_bound).
