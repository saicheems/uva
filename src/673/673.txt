I chose to solve this problem using a stack. If the current character in the
string is a open parentheses/bracket, push it to the stack. If it isn't, look
at the top element of the stack and check to see if it closes the current
character. If it does, pop the element and continue. If it doesn't return
false. After the loop, make sure you check to see that the size of the stack is
0. If you don't, we will fail cases like '(' or '()('.
