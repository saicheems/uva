The most potent corner

Process
This problem is asking you to find the two connected corners on an
n-dimensional cube such that the sum of the weights of all corners connected to
the two is the maximum for that cube. O(N^2) isn't going to cut it, so you
can't loop through all the corners twice and find which ones are connected.
Instead, use bit manipulation to flip each bit of a corner (since they are read
in in natural order) to determine what it's connected to. For example, corner 0
(000) is connected to corner 1 (001), corner 2 (010) and corner 4 (100). Record
the sums for each corner, and loop through once more to find the two adjacent
corners with maximum sum. The formula for flipping the nth bit of k is n ^ (1
<< k).
