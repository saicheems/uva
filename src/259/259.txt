Software allocation

Process
This problem can be solved using max flow with a pretty ingenious mapping. Here
we have a total possible 26 applications and 10 computers in total. We want to
match all of the users who bring in an application to a computer that can run
it. Only 1 computer can run an application, so we have lots of constraints that
resemble max flow. Consider this, we have a universal source that connects to
all 26 applications (A through Z). Each edge from source to application has the
weight of the number of users that brought in that application. For example, if
4 people brought in application A, the weight from the universal source to A is
4. Then, we connect each of the applications to the computers it can run on
with infinite edge weights. Finally, we connect each of the ten computers to a
universal sink with edge weight 1, representing the 1 application limit for
each computer. To check if there is a possible allocation, we see if the max
flow is equal to the number of applications brought in. If they are equal, we
can find the computers that were allocated by checking the weight of the edge
from the computer to each of the applications. If the edge weight is 1, that
means that application is run on that computer.
