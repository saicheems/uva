Process
We can solve this problem by making a number of observations about the sequence
of odd numbers. We're given the number of elements in the row of interest. The
(number of elements in a row / 2) is the row number. You can observe that the
square of the row number is the number of the last element in the row in the
whole sequence. For
example:
1
3 5 7           <- row 2
9 11 13 15 17   <- row 3

7 is the 2^2 element
17 is the 3^2 element

From here, it is trivial to calculate the value of the last odd number in any
row (((row number)^2)*2-1). The rest should be obvious. You'll need to use
long longs as the largest output can reach 2^63.
