Following orders

Process
I solved this problem using recursive backtracing. I kept track of previously
visited letters, and checked to see if any of the node connections had already
been visited. If not, I continued recursing. Make sure you sort the list of
letters you get at the beginning if you use my method. That way you get the
correctly ordered answer every time.
