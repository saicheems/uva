Process
This problem is simple if we use bit operations. Use a long long because our
number can stretch to 2^64. We can keep bit-shifting our number to the right
and increment P if the rightmost bit is a 1. We stop iterating once the
leftover value is 0. I created the binary representation by adding the
rightmost bit to a vector and printing it backwards.
