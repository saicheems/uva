Bender B. Rodr√≠guez problem

Process
Keep track of the direction of the last segment of the wire, it is the only
section that matters. I chose to use a map of maps to store the bend directions
to avoid a confusing if tree. I figured out by hand what directions the wire
would point if a bend was made in a certain direction. Then it was as simple as
setting the wire to the new direction indicated by my map. Also, you'll have to
use a long to store L.
