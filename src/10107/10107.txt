What is the median?

Process
I chose to solve this problem by maintaining a vector and sorting after each
new entry is added. I printed the average between the middle 2 values if the
number of entries is even, and the middle value if not. I wrote a second
solution afterwards with a more efficient solution in mind. Since we're given
one value at a time, we can do an insertion sort instead of a full sort for a
bit of extra speed by checking for the first value greater than the scanned
value and swapping the two.
