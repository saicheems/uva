Process
This problem is relatively straightforward. You need to store each figure in an
array (I used an array of structs for simplicity) and check if any point is
contained within them in order. For the rectangle, check if the point is within
bounds. For the circle, check if the euclidian distance from the center of the
circle to the point is <= r (radius).
