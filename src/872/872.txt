UVA 872
Ordering

Process
I solved this problem using recursive backtracing. I used a vector to hold the
elements, a vector of vectors to hold the adjacency list, and a map to keep
track of visited nodes. I used a modified dfs method that recursed on each
element if it didn't break the rules (being that an element which much appear
afterwards wasn't already used). I wrote a method to check whether a rule was
broken by checking already visited elements.
