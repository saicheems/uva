Division of Nlogonia

Process
This problem is very straightforward. The premise is to output what new
section of Nlogonia a pair of coordinates is in. We're given the
intersection point of the division lines, so we print divisa if a person is
on the line, and one of NE, SE, SO, or NO depending on what side of the
division point each person is on.
