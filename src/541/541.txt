Process
We can use some basic math to analyze this one. If we change the value of a
bit, the sum of its respective column and row will be changed by 1. As a
result, by changing only one bit we can change only one column and row.
Therefore, if the sums of more than one column or row is odd, the matrix is
"Corrupt". If none are odd, the matrix is "OK", and if only one of each is odd
- that row and column bit can be changed to give the matrix the parity
property.
