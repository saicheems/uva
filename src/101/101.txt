The blocks problem

Process
This problem is an exercise in tedium. Be sure to read the directions - if you
follow them precisely you will get AC. Keep a vector of vectors and write
methods for each operation. Be careful of removing elements in vectors, as
using for loops to do so is tricky if you are iterating based on an original
size. Be sure to skip cases where the elements are in the same column or a ==
b. I wrote an O(N^2) method to find the column and row of an element - that
should work fine.
