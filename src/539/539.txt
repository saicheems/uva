UVA 539:
The settlers of Catan

Process
This problem can be solved by multiple depth first searches (since there can be
disconnected sets). The trick is to keep track of visited edges instead of
nodes, and mark each edge unvisited after making the recursive call. This is to
make sure we traverse all possible directional paths.
