Process
This problem can be solved using the O(N^2) longest increasing subsequence
dynamic programming technique. In this case however, we're not necessarily
interested in the longest chain of increasing buildings but longest sum of
widths of an arbitrary chain of buildings. That means that if a single building
has a longer width than the sum of those of a chain of 5 buildings, we pick the
single building. Thus a simple modification to the standard algorithm can be
used - just store the maximum observed width at each index where the building
at index i is taller (or shorter for the decreasing part of the problem) than
the building at index j.
