The skyline problem

Process
It took me a while to figure out how to solve this one. My method was to make an
array containing heights. As a scanned each new building, I went from index L to
R in my array and set the value at the index = H if H > the value in that index.
This makes sense as the tallest buildings will always be visible in the skyline.
The next step was just to read back this array and make note of a change in
height. If height changes, print both the index (the x change) and the height
(the y change). If we iterate to 1 past the maximum right value, the trailing 0
is added.

Input
1 11 5
2 6 7
3 13 9
12 7 16
14 3 25
19 18 22
23 13 29
24 4 28

Output
1 11 3 13 9 0 12 7 16 3 19 18 22 3 23 13 29 0
