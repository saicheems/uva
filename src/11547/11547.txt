Process
Not really any tricks to this problem. I used a long long to be on the safe
side, but I don't think it's actually needed after some quick checks on my
calculator. To get the digit in the tens column of a number, you can divide by
10 and use mod 10.
For example, to get the tens digit of 257:
257 / 10 = 25
25 % 10 = 5.
