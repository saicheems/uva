Page hopping

Process
This problem is a shortest paths one. Store the maximum node value as "N", and
compile an adjacency matrix with the input. Run floyd warshall to calculate all
pairs shortest paths - then iterate through the weight matrix, keep a running
total and number of non-inf path weights, and output the average.

Input
1 2 2 4 1 3 3 1 4 3 0 0
1 2 1 4 4 2 2 7 7 1 0 0
0 0

Output
Case 1: average length between pages = 1.833 clicks
Case 2: average length between pages = 1.750 clicks
