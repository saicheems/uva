First of all, this is an incredibly bad problem. The trick is based on
incorrect math. The only reason I even found out how to solve it is by checking
the UVa forums for a tip (only did so because I was frustrated...). The premise
is straightforward - find what range of factorials is within 10000 and
6227020800. That calculation can be done very easily. There's some flawed logic
regarding negative inputs however. I assumed there would be no negative inputs
because negative factorials are undefined. Of course, the factorial of 0 (0 /
0) is undefined. The problem assumes this value to be infinity! As a result, an
even factorial is an underflow, and an odd factorial is an overflow.
Mathematically, this is blatantly wrong, so I think this is a poor problem
altogether. You can see what the idea behind the logic is here:
