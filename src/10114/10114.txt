Loansome car buyer

Process
Simulate the process described and you should be good. Note that the monthly
payment is the loan amount / duration, and that it starts on the first month.
Depending on how you code you solution, you may need to check for a case where
0 months is the output (when the initial depreciation of the car is greater
than the loan amount). Also, note that the output for 1 is not plural - "1
month" v "4 months."
