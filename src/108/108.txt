Maximum sum

Process
I solved this problem by using the 2d range sum dynamic programming technique.
I recalculated each index of the matrix to be the sum of the sub matrix from
0,0 to that index, and then reconstructed all possible sub matrices in an
O(N^4) process. This is good enough to get AC, as the brute force approach is
O(N^6), which is too large.
