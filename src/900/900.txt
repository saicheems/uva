Process
The problem becomes simple if we can observe a pattern.
Here are the possible configurations for n bricks.
1:  |                                               1 configuration
2:  ||, =                                           2 configurations
3:  ||, |=, =|                                      3 configurations
4:  ||||, ||=, |=|, ||=, ==                         5 configurations
5:  |||||, |||=, ||=|, |=||, =|||, |==, =|=, ==|    8 configurations

We can start to see a famous pattern emerging - the fibonacci sequence!
The solution is as simple as coding a fibonacci generator for i up to 50.
