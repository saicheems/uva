Process
I used Java to solve this one. String reversal and large number addition are
just easier with BigInteger and StringBuilder classes. Since numbers can be as
long as 200 characters, standard data types won't cut it. I read in each number
as a String, used StringBuilder to reverse it, added them with BigInteger, and
reversed the sum again using StringBuilder. I had an extra routine at the end
to remove leading 0s.
