Process
The fastest solution I can think of is to manually map each character to
another in a 256 entry char array. I coded for speed this time though, so I
made a keyboard string and mapping string. I scanned through the keyboard
string for each character of the input and printed out its corresponding
mapping. At the end be sure to print an end line.
