Process
We can solve this problem in c++ using some modular arithmetic. Keep a running
modulus, and for each digit in the number, add the current digit (to the
running mod), multiply by 10, and mod by 11. After performing the operation for
all digits, if the original number is divisible by 11, your running mod will be
0.  You'll have to check if the value read in is 0 and that its length is 1 if
you're using c strings. I think they might be giving inputs such as 00111.
