This is a very simple problem once you deduce the pattern. First I wrote a
simple method to sum up the total number of bottles you can enjoy. Note that it
does not include empty bottles from the total as these cannot be enjoyed (no
soda!). The key idea is that any even number of full bottles produces 2
leftover bottles, and any odd number of full bottles produces a single leftover
bottle. Thus, if N is even, we can borrow 2 empty bottles and have 2 leftover
bottles to give back. If N is odd, we can borrow at most one (if we borrow two
we will have only one bottle left). Borrowing a bottle if N is odd makes no
difference however - the total sum ends up being the same. Here are some
examples of the process:

(b represents a full bottle, e an empty one)
Given ten bottles:
b b b | b b b | b b b | b
b b b | e
b e <- total is 10 + 3 + 1 = 14

If we borrow two empty bottles:
b b b | b b b | b b b | b e e
b b b | b
b e <- total is 10 + 4 + 1 = 15, we have enough to give back

Given eleven bottles:
b b b | b b b | b b b | b b
b b b | e e
b e e
b <- total is 11 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 16

If we borrow an empty bottle:
b b b | b b b | b b b | b b e
b b b | b
b | e <- total is 11 + 4 + 1 = 16
