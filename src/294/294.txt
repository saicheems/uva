Process
This one is a pretty interesting math problem. We need to find the number
within the range from L to U with the largest number of divisors. I chose to do
this using a prime factorization algorithm along with the sieve of
Eratosthenes. The process is as follows:
1. Generate all primes up to 35,000 (the number with the largest prime factors
under a billion is 31627 * 31607.
2. Use a prime factorization algorithm to determine the factors and
multiplicity of a number. We can determine the number of total factors from the
number of prime factors by taking the multiplicities of each factor (a, b,
c...) and multiplying them as (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1)...
You can check this reasoning here:

3. For all values in the range, calculate the total number of factors for each
number and store the one with the largest number.
