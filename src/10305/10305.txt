Process
This problem is asking you to write a topological sort. The procedure is to
iterate over each node in the graph and run a DFS on each one. Mark each
visited node as seen, and then add them to the front of an output list (now
that I write this, it would be more efficient to write to the back and print
the list in reverse).
