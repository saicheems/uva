Process
This problem is asking you to devise an algorithm to sort the flapjack stack
sub-optimally (because there is no efficient optimal pancake sorter). The
algorithm is as follows. Look for the largest element in the stack, flip it to
the end, and then flip it to it's correct place at the bottom. There are two
cases where the pancake is in the correct place and where the pancake is at the
end of the stack you will have to deal with.
