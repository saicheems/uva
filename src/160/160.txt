Process
My original solution for this problem is poor. I'm not going to explain each
line but the general idea. It should be apparent that the factors of a large
factorial are the factors of all the numbers involved in the factorial. For
example, the prime factorization of 5! is the prime factorizations of 2, 3, 4,
and 5 multiplied. I used the sieve of eratosthenes to generate all the primes
under a 100 and a prime factorization method to calculate the prime
factorizations of each number. From there the problem is just extraneous code.
It is possible to shorten this one by just providing the primes under 100
yourself in an array and bypassing the sieve. I need a less messy method of
determining what the final values to print should be - so I'll come back to
this one in the future.
