Process
I used a few tricks for this one. First, I kept 3 arrays that indicated the
number of times the roman numerals i, v, and x appeared from 0 to 9. Then I
kept 3 more arrays that indicated the number of times the roman numerals x, l,
and c appeared in the tens and hundreds digits from 0 to 100 (going by steps of
10). From here we can do some addition to calculate totals. The number of times
each letter appears has a direct relationship to the number of times it appears
in the tens digit and the ones digit. You can verify this relationship yourself
by checking a list of roman numerals online.
