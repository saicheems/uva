Hamiltonian cycle

Process
I solved this problem using dfs. I started at node 0 and searched until I found
a path of length n where the final node in the path has an edge to 0. The dfs
method may need some tweaking to get TLE - otherwise the hardest part of this
problem is reading input. I chose to use strcmp and sscanf to grab the edge
values and stop at %.
