Good god, this problem is a pain in the butt to code and get AC. First off,
you'll probably want to use java so you can use the Calendar class. Read in and
parse the starting date and add 40 weeks to that. From there, instantiate your
zodiac month calendars and set their dates according to the table given and the
year of the input date + 40 weeks. I used a big if tree to test whether or not
a date fell within a zodiac sign, and printed the name if so. Note that the
output is in MM/DD/YYYY format, meaning that you'll have to print leading 0's.
If you went the same route as me, also note that the test for Capricorn should
be equal to or after December 23 OR before January 20, not AND.
