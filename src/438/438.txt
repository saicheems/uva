Process
In order to calculate the circumference of our circle, we first need to know
the radius. Given a triangle, you can observe that by drawing perpendicular
lines from the midpoint of the three line segments, the three lines formed will
all intersect the radius of the circle. Therefore, we can do some math by
calculating two lines perpendicular to the bisection of the segments and
calculating their intersection.
First you need to find the midpoints of the line segments. Note that if two
points have the same y coordinate, the slope of the line perpendicular to their
midpoint will be inf. I chose to skip such segments and operate on the other
two - it is up to you how you want to deal with that scenario.
Midpoints are given by (x1 + x2) / 2 and (y1 + y2) / 2.
You can calculate the slope of the perpendicular line as (y1 - y2) / (x1 - x2).
Then the perpendicular lines going through the midpoints of the segments are
given by:
(y - y1) + m * (x - x1) = 0
From here you can do some algebra to calculate the radius point. Finally
circumference is 2 * pi * r.
